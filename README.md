## Example1 : [Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope](https://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Dynamic_2D_Effective_Stress_Analysis_of_Slope)
The slope is modeled in two-dimensions and it is assumed that the slope is underlain by an elastic half-space. The free-field response of the soil is considered through the use of massive columns of soil with periodic boundary conditions located at both ends of the model. Four-node quadrilateral elements with both displacement and pore pressure degrees of freedom enable the model to track changes in pore pressure and effective stress during the course of the analysis. A Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot is utilized to account for the finite rigidity of the underlying elastic medium.
